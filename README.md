# Fundamental computer Programming - C++ Lab II Homework
### course code: CS112 A6
### Lecturer: Quang-Thai Ho

The professor mistakenly assigned Assignment 3, but I have already completed it.

Therefore, there are two files: hw-3 and hw-3-2 (*correct version*).

However, the content of Assignment 3 will be used in Task 1 of Assignment 3-2.

|ASSIGNMENT|CONTENT|
|----------|-------|
|ASSIGNMENT 1|Classes and Objects in C++|
|ASSIGNMENT 2|inheritance & Overloading in C++|
|ASSIGNMENT 3|Operator in C++|
|ASSIGNMENT 3-2|Template & Files in C++|

If you have any programming questions, feel free to email me for discussion.
